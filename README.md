OSDL-Snake
==========

This repository corresponds to the part of the [OSDL project](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/OSDL) gathering all general-purpose developments in Python, notably YAG-OSDL, a simple generator of HTML galleries, created typically to facilitate the browsing of sets of snapshots, possibly sorted by themes.

Refer to the [YAG-OSDL](https://olivier-boudeville.github.io/OSDL-Snake/) page for further information.
